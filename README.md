# Welcome to my Development Space!

I have recently decided to try a design philosophy of features being completely condensed (where ever possible) to a single file. These files are kept in the features folder, with the default files and folders merely handling the 'plugging in' of the features with as little footprint as possible.

This should allow others to plug and play my work into their own projects following the install instructions as outlined in each individual feature file.

Features are INOPERABLE/BETA/COMPLETE as marked.
