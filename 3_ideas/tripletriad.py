Triple Triad Card Game - INOPERABLE

The first step to becoming a successful Triple Triad competitor is building a
deck.

After completing the quest "Triple Triad Trial," players will receive five
cards. Using the cards in your inventory will register them to your Card List,
which can be accessed by selecting Gold Saucer under Character in the main
menu. To create a deck, access Card Decks, also located within the Gold Saucer
options, and select one of the five available slots to assign cards to a deck.

Once you have prepared a deck, speak with the Triple Triad Master to engage her
in a tutorial match.

New cards can be obtained from the Triple Triad Trader NPC found in the
Manderville Gold Saucer, as rewards from  winning against various NPCs, and as
prizes from Triple Triad tournaments.

Unwanted cards in your inventory, such as doubles of those already registered
to your card list, can be sold for MGP  to the Triple Triad NPC in the
Manderville Gold Saucer (X:4.1 Y:7.4).

Certain NPCs are willing to play a game of Triple Triad with you. Such NPCs
can be identified by a unique icon over their heads. For a small amount of MGP,
players can challenge them to matches, and potentially win additional MGP and
acquire new cards.

Other players can also be challenged to Triple Triad matches. To issue a
challenge, target your desired opponent and select Challenge to Normal Match
from the subcommand menu. Although no fee is incurred, neither are there card
rewards to be had. However, players will receive an MGP bonus for up to five
wins every day. Eligibility to receive this bonus is reset every day at
7:00 a.m. (PST). The rules for the match are set by the player issuing the
challenge. Moreover, a challenge can only be issued in areas designated for
Triple Triad matches.


As of patch 2.51, 80 varieties of Triple Triad cards are available. While some
cards can be purchased with MGP at the Manderville Gold Saucer, others can be
obtained as rewards from defeating NPCs, Triple Triad Tournaments, and the
completion of certain duties. As cards cannot be traded or purchased from the
market, players are encouraged to challenge NPCs and journey throughout Eorzea
in search of rare and powerful cards.

All cards can be classified by rarity (one to five stars). Initially, each
deck can only contain one card with a rarity rating higher than one star. As
you acquire more cards, however, the restriction becomes less prohibitive, and
will eventually only apply to the highest tiers of rarity.

Basic Rules:
1. Two players take turns placing cards on a three-by-three grid.
2. The player who goes first is decided at random.
3. When it is your turn, you must place a card on one of the open spaces on
the grid.
4. When a card is placed, the numbers representing its four sides are compared
to any adjacent cards. If a number on the card placed is greater than the
number it faces on an adjacent card, you will flip that card and capture it.
5. The objective is to capture and control more cards than your opponent.
After nine cards have been played, the player who controls more cards is the
winner. Note that the unplayed 10th card is also counted.

Advanced Rules:
In addition to the basic rules, there are a number of advanced rules that can
alter the way a Triple Triad match is played. They can be applied under a
variety of circumstances, and can be considered either "regional rules" or
"match rules."

Regional Rules
Regional rules vary by location, and are reset daily at 7:00 a.m. (PST). Up to
two regional rules are in effect at any given time, and certain preferences may
be observed in each region. It is worth noting, however, that certain NPCs will
not adhere to regional rules.

Match Rules
Match rules are decided upon by the participants. A maximum of two match rules
can be in effect at any one time, and are set automatically by NPC opponents.
When challenging fellow player characters, however, you are given the decision
as to which match rules will be in play. Regional rules can also take effect
when challenging fellow players. As a result, when two match rules are set by
an opposing player, a maximum of four rules can be in effect during any given
match.

Advanced Rules:

All Open
A rule wherein all five cards in each deck are made visible to both players.

Three Open
A rule wherein three random cards in each deck are made visible to both players.

Same
A rule that adds a new condition to the capture mechanic. If the numbers of two
or more cards are the same as the numbers on the adjacent sides of the card you
place, you gain control of every matching card.
This rule also allows you to score a "Combo" capture. Should the cards you
capture lie adjacent to "weaker" cards (i.e. cards with smaller numbers on the
neighboring sides), those cards will fall under your control as well. Only one
of the two or more matching cards needs to belong to your opponent for the Same
capture mechanic to take effect.

Same Wall
An extension of the Same rule. The edges of the board are counted as A ranks
for the purposes of the Same rule.

Sudden Death
When "Sudden Death" is in effect, any match that ends in a draw will be
restarted from turn one. Your deck for this new match will consist of the cards
you had control over at the end of the previous game. Sudden Death will
continue until one player wins or until five more consecutive drawn matches
have been played, at which point the game will result in a draw.

Plus
A rule that adds a new condition to the capture mechanic. If the numbers of two
or more cards have the same total when added to the numbers on the adjacent
sides of the card you place, you gain control of every matching card.
This rule also allows you to score a "Combo" capture. Should the cards you
capture lie adjacent to "weaker" cards (i.e. cards with smaller numbers on the
neighboring sides), those cards will fall under your control as well. Only one
of the two or more matching cards needs to belong to your opponent for the Plus
capture mechanic to take effect.

Random
A rule wherein your chosen deck will be replaced with five cards selected at
random from your entire card list.

Order
A rule wherein you are required to play each card in the order that it appears
in your deck.

Chaos
A rule wherein the card you play each turn is selected at random from your
deck.

Reverse
A rule wherein the conditions for capturing cards are switched so that smaller
numbers are more powerful than larger numbers.

Fallen Ace
A rule wherein the all-powerful "A" becomes susceptible to capture by the lowly
"1." If the Reverse rule is also in play, a "1" will then become vulnerable to
capture by an "A."

Ascension
A rule that affects cards that are grouped into a specific type, such as
"Primal" or "Beastman." When placed on the playing grid, the number values on
these cards are increased by one for every card of that type that is in play.
Numbers that are increased to "11" or more are considered to be of "A" rank.

Descension
A rule that affects cards that are grouped into a specific type, such as
"Primal" or "Beastman." When placed on the playing grid, the number values on
these cards are decreased by one for every card of that type that is in play.
Any number that is decreased to "0" or less is treated as a "1."

Swap
A rule wherein one card from your deck is switched with one of your opponent's
before the match begins. The cards to be swapped are chosen at random, and are
returned to their original owners at the end of the game.

Roulette
When the "Roulette" rule is in effect, the advanced rules for the match will
be chosen at random.

Combo
Of the cards captured by the Same, Same Wall or Plus rule, if they are adjacent
to another card whose rank is lower, it is captured as well. This is not a
separate rule; any time Same or Plus is in effect, Combo is in effect as well.

Elemental
In the elemental rule, one or more of the spaces are randomly marked with an
element. Some cards have elements in the upper-right corner. Ruby Dragon, for
example, is fire-elemental, and Quezacotl is thunder-elemental. When an
elemental card is placed on a corresponding element, each rank goes up a point.
When any card is placed on a non-matching element, each rank goes down a point.
This does not affect the Same, Plus and Same Wall rules where the cards'
original ranks apply.
