Alright, so I have this idea for combat. Where "turns" are really just 
oppurtunities to make decisions. So a battle starts, both players pick an 
action (a punch or a kick or a block etc), your perception determines when 
you'll identify what your opponent is doing and give you an oppurtunity to 
change your option, Their perception will give them the option to respond etc 
etc. I'm imagining it ended up like an text based Toribash 

The problem is combat would take an inordinate amount of time 

So instead of the battles happenign in real time, the idea is that when a 
"battle" is happening, the particpants outwardly look like their mediating 
or focusing 

Whilst the participants are working out combat. Then when it concludes, it 
plays out in real timeLike this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rylEfnxeUZo 

 

 

You program the movements – You give it the name – You practice to get quicker 
at those movements. 

 

Focus on a certain body part to pick up those things more readily. 

 

 

Battle's with NPC's will be more about puzzles. Working out their weaknesses. 

 

High end characters will instanntly be able to respond to low level players 
actions, and move and attack so fast that low level players won't be able 
to see.
